THREAD?


2 ways to define a thread
1. by extending thread class
2. by implmenting runnable interface

public class ThreadDemo{

psvm(){
}
}


public class MyThread extends Thread { //

@Override
public void run(){

}

}



thread scheduler: responsible to schedule thread... if multiple threads are waiting, in which order thread must be executed is decided by the thread scheduler. 




1. searched for schoools
2. finalised a school
3. we got admission
4. we school uniform
5. we dropped our kid inside/near the school campus

----------------------------


1. xyz , i'm dropping near the school. 


-------------

start() -> 70k lines of code

1. register thread with thread scheduler
2. perform all the mandatory activities required for the thread
3. invoke run();
t. start() -> heart of multithreading.  



can override, but that's not advisable...
--

NOT RECOMMENDED -> TO OVERRIDE START METHOD, AND TO OVERLOAD THE RUN METHOD
