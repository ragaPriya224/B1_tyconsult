TASKS:

Create an abstract class 'Bank' with an abstract method 'getBalance'. $100, $150 and $200 are deposited in banks A, B and C respectively. 'BankA', 'BankB' and 'BankC' are subclasses of class 'Bank', each having a method named 'getBalance'. Call this method by creating an object of each of the three classes.

Create an abstract class 'Animals' with two abstract methods 'cats' and 'dogs'. Now create a class 'Cats' with a method 'cats' which prints "Cats meow" and a class 'Dogs' with a method 'dogs' which prints "Dogs bark", both inheriting the class 'Animals'. Now create an object for each of the subclasses and call their respective methods.
