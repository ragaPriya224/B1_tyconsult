SET:

child interface of collectio 

dup no

ins order not maintained

no specific methods

underlying: hashtable

(not necessary to understand indepth as of now, just see overview : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs0KM3wKv8  )

freq operation: search

null ok

hetero data

constructors: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html

Load Factor -> After loading how much factor, a new hashset object will be created. That is called as load factor

---------------------------------------------------
**LINKED HASH SET**

1.When to go -> ????    When insertion order is preserved

Underlying DS: hashtable +linkedlist

version ->1.4version

**sortedSET**


sorted set

child interface of set

represent group of individual according to some sorting order 

duplicate -> no

method specific:

first()

last()

headSet()

tailSet()

subset()
