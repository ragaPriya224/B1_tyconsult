1. LIST, SET STRUCTURE MUGUP (ignore version, just remember the parent, child, which is class, interface )
2. imp point: duplicate allowable? insertion order maintainable?
3.try using common methods in arraylist, linkedlist, hashset, linkedhashset, treeset

add, addAll, clear, contains, isEmpty, remove, size

4.arraylist  -> dup ok
order ok
heterogenous data allowed
null insertion possible

and then explore specific methods: bcoz arraylist ds is growable array
so explore:

add, addAll,  remove,  get,indexOf, lastIndexof, set-> replace 

5. linkedlist
dup ok
order ok 
heterogenous data allowed
null insertion possible

 specific METHoDS bcoz underlying ds is doubled linked list 
	addFirst(E e)
  addLast(E e)
getFirst
getLast
removeFirst
removeLast

6. difference between arraylist and linkedlist, as we have completed both the topics completely

     ArrayList                	linkedList
best    retrieval	    	       insertion,deletion
worst   insesrtion/deletion      retrieval 



7. normal overview of SET:
child interface of collection
dup no
ins order not maintained
no specific methods

explore hashset with common methods such as add, addAll, clear, contains, isEmpty, remove, size
and also note, how the datas are stored(their insertion order) and whether duplicates are allowed 

explore linked hashset with common methods such as add, addAll, clear, contains, isEmpty, remove, size
and also note, how the datas are stored(their insertion order) and whether duplicates are allowed 




8. then we have to explore treeset, which is implementation class of sortedset and navigable set
in treeset object, try checking whether dup allowed, insertion order, null allowed, hetero datas allowed. 

explore special methods such as: 
first()
last()
headSet()
tailSet()
subset()
