ANALOGY:

Assume that , we're going to outing on a weekend. and before going out, our mom asks us to buya list of groceries
Let's assume we went to a mall.
First, we entered a dress shop,
   we'll buy unique dresses.that is, we won't buy same design , same colour dresssess again and again. we don't prefer duplicate dress. we prefer unique dresses
Next, we entered a groceries shop,
   Yeah,If we forget items, we can't manage our mom :P  . so now, we were okay with duplicates. i.e., buying same milk packet twice, same choclate, same weight again 
    and again and buying 20 rupee maggi packet thrice.. we were totally okay with duplicates
 Then, we were so tired,so we entered a cafeteria
    if you see menu, it will have food name and food price.. food item name will not be repeated(not duplicated), but price can be duplicated.for eg: tea and coffee
      might be of same price. 
So, see during shopping, once we required, duplicates sometimes we preferred unique items..sometimes we were okay with food prices be duplicated
